# Batch Upload PDF-to-Scoring Implementation Plan

This plan outlines the steps to implement a feature that allows users to upload batch files (PDF, CSV, Excel), map fields, transform the data to the app's schema, and send it to the scoring engine.

---

## 1. Frontend: Batch Upload UI
- [] Design a drag-and-drop/file picker component for PDF, CSV, Excel
- [ ] Show upload progress and file validation feedback
- [ ] Display extracted data preview after upload

## 2. Backend: File Parsing & Extraction
- [ ] Add endpoint to accept file uploads (PDF, CSV, Excel)
- [ ] Integrate PDF parsing (pdf-parse/pdf2json/tesseract.js for OCR)
- [ ] Integrate CSV/Excel parsing (csv-parse/xlsx)
- [ ] Return extracted data to frontend for mapping/preview

## 3. Field Mapping & Template Profiles
- [ ] Build/extend field mapping UI (possibly using FieldMappingBuilder.jsx)
- [ ] Allow user to map extracted fields to internal schema
- [ ] Optionally, auto-detect known templates and apply saved mappings
- [ ] Save mapping profiles for future uploads

## 4. Data Transformation & Validation
- [ ] Transform mapped data to internal format
- [ ] Validate required fields, data types, and business rules
- [ ] Show errors/warnings in the UI if validation fails

## 5. Scoring Integration
- [ ] Send validated, transformed data to scoring engine endpoint
- [ ] Display scoring results or errors to the user (using notification bar)

## 6. Quality of Life & Enhancements
- [ ] Add audit logging for uploads, mappings, and scoring events
- [ ] Allow download of error reports or transformed data
- [ ] Add support for additional file types/templates as needed
