# üõ°Ô∏è Security, Error Handling, and Testing Improvements

## 1. Authentication & Authorization

- JWTs are now stored in httpOnly cookies (not localStorage) for secure, XSS-resistant authentication.
- All login, registration, and protected routes use cookie-based authentication.
- No tokens are ever exposed to frontend JavaScript.

---

## 2. CSRF Protection

- CSRF protection is enabled using the `csurf` middleware.
- A `/api/v1/csrf-token` endpoint provides the CSRF token to the frontend.
- All state-changing requests (POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH) require a valid CSRF token in the `X-CSRF-Token` header.
- Frontend automatically fetches and attaches the CSRF token for all relevant requests.

---

## 3. Frontend Security & Error Handling

- All legacy token logic removed from the frontend.
- API calls use `withCredentials: true` to send/receive cookies.
- Centralized error extraction helper (`extractApiError`) ensures all API errors show clear, user-friendly messages.
- Global React Error Boundary prevents the app from crashing on unexpected errors and provides a user-friendly fallback UI.

---

## 4. Backend Error Handling

- All errors are routed through a global error handler (`AppError`).
- Standardized error response structure for all API errors:
  ```json
  {
    "status": "error",
    "message": "Something went wrong",
    "details": { ... } // if available
  }
  ```
- Controllers use `next(new AppError(...))` for all error cases (validation, forbidden, not found, etc.).
- Validation and file upload errors include details for easier debugging.

---

## 5. Testing

- Automated backend tests using Jest + Supertest:
  - Login (with/without CSRF, invalid credentials)
  - Registration (success, duplicate, validation errors)
  - Protected route access (with/without login)
  - Error structure validation
- Test setup is compatible with ES modules.
- CI/CD runs `npm audit` on both frontend and backend for every push/PR.

---

## 6. CI/CD & Dependency Security

- GitHub Actions workflow runs `npm audit --audit-level=moderate` for both frontend and backend.
- Build fails on moderate or higher vulnerabilities.

---

## 7. Codebase Modernization

- All backend code uses ES module syntax (`import`/`export`).
- Controllers, middleware, and utilities are fully modernized.

---

## 8. How to Run & Test

### Backend
```sh
cd backend
npm install
npm start         # Start the backend server
npm test          # Run backend tests
```

### Frontend
```sh
cd frontend
npm install
npm start         # Start the frontend dev server
```

### CI/CD
- On every push/PR, GitHub Actions will:
  - Run `npm audit` for both frontend and backend.
  - Run backend tests.

---

## 9. How to Add New Features Securely

- Always use `next(new AppError(...))` for errors in controllers.
- For new state-changing endpoints, ensure CSRF protection is enforced.
- Use the `extractApiError` helper for all API error handling in the frontend.
- Add tests for new endpoints and error cases.

---

## 10. Further Recommendations

- Expand backend and frontend tests for all critical business logic.
- Add API documentation (Swagger, Postman, etc.).
- Monitor logs and set up alerts for production errors.
